This repository holds the resources associated to paper _**Two Ontology Design Patterns in the domain of Collections**_.

The Ontology Design Patterns are the following:

+ ODP *Permutation* for representing ordered collections without repetition.
+ ODP *ListOfPermutations* for representing ordered permutations of the same elements.
